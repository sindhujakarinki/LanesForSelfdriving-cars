Line Detection: Make an Autonomous Car see Road Lines
Step by step you can turn a video stream into a line detector via Computer Vision
We will design the hole pipeline step-by-step, in which we will motivate why we are doing it.<br>
• Grayscale transform<br>
• Gaussian Blur<br>
• Canny Edge Detection<br>
• Mask a region of interest<br>
• Hough lines Detector<br>
• Find the Road Lines<br>
