Line Detection: Make an Autonomous Car see Road Lines
Step by step you can turn a video stream into a line detector via Computer Vision
We will design the hole pipeline step-by-step, in which we will motivate why we are doing it.
• Grayscale transform
• Gaussian Blur
• Canny Edge Detection
• Mask a region of interest
• Hough lines Detector
• Find the Road Lines
